If you're a beginner and need a head start with MATLAB/Octave programming, you can choose to view these programs, edit them as you like and get an intuition. In some of these programs, I've added some updates with and named them by version numbers. Some basic concepts like file handling, user interaction and plotting are covered in these programs.

**How to Use?**\
You can use either MATLAB or Octave for executing these programs. If you don't have a MATLAB liscense, you can use Octave, which is launched under GNU GPLv3, which is a free software and allows you to run, study, share and modify the software.

**Important**\
You can edit, modify and use these programs in any way you like, for personal and commercial purposes. These are meant for providing an insight on basic programming in MATLAB/Octave, and there's no need to cite/credit this repository.
